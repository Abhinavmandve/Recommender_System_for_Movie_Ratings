Recommender System for Movie Ratings

Objective :
To build a movie recommender system using collaborative filtering.

Approach :
Used the MovieLens dataset containing 100,000 ratings of 9,000 movies by 600 users. Conducted data
preprocessing, including filtering users and movies with fewer ratings, to optimize the model's performance.
Built a collaborative filtering model using matrix factorization with alternating least squares optimization.
Implemented the model using the Surprise package in Python. Evaluated the model using root mean squared
error (RMSE)
